# Cluster Chrome Extension

The Cluster Chrome Extension allows users to open their most-used related webpages with a single click. Often, we visit a set of pages that go hand in hand and wouldn't make sense without each other. For example, if you have a personal email account and school/work account, you would most likely want to open both of these to check for anything new. With this chrome extension, you can store links for both of these emails in a "cluster" and with a single click of a button, both will open up.

Cluster replaces your Google Chrome homepage and provides 8 clusters, including Work, School, Mail, Music, Entertainment, Social Media, Sports, and Shopping. If perhaps you do not have multiple links that you want associated to a cluster, you can simply treat it as a favorites button and add a single link. Additionally, there is a custom greeting personalized with your own name. 

Version 1.1.0 comes with the ability to change your background to 10 high-definition themes so you can further personalize your home screen!
